👋 Hello!

I'm Alexis Jacomy, aka [@jacomyal](https://github.com/jacomyal), a Front-End Engineer specialized in **graphical rendering** and **data visualization**.

I'm part of the innovative team at **[OuestWare](https://www.ouestware.com)**, an agency based in Nantes, France. We specialize in developing **web applications** for **data exploration**.

As a part of my work at OuestWare, I'm the main developer and maintainer of **[sigma.js](https://sigmajs.org)**, an open-source library focused on efficiently displaying networks within web pages.

We also develop:
- **[Gephi Lite](https://gephi.org/gephi-lite/)**, a web-based, lighter version of [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), the networks visualization and exploration software;
- **[Retina](https://ouestware.gitlab.io/retina)**, a web application to share graph visualizations online.

Finally, I sometimes write on [🐘 Mastodon](https://vis.social/@jacomyal) or on [🗒 OuestWare's blog](https://www.ouestware.com/en/blog/).

Thank you for visiting, and let's connect!
